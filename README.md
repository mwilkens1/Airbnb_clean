## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I wanted to analyse Amsterdam Airbnb data to answer the following questions:

1. How high are Airbnb cleaning fees and how much do they vary?
2. What can explain the level of cleaning fees?
3. Are higher cleaning fees related to a higher score on cleanliness?
4. Given that cleaning fees are a one-off payment, by how much does the average nightly rate decrease if you book longer?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 Jupyter notebook with all the code. The folder 'data' contains the csv datafile that I downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. The [datafile](http://data.insideairbnb.com/the-netherlands/north-holland/amsterdam/2019-12-07/data/listings.csv.gz) that I used is from 7 December 2019. The folder 'plots' contains a few images of plots that I used in my blog post.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@mathijn.wilkens/the-price-of-cleanliness-66557a0918ad).
